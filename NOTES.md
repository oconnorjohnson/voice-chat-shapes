Ideas:

- trigger different characters with different flags on command
- trigger voice chat on a discord flag command

next:

- replace whisper with deepgram nova
- analyze python script to reduce latency in processing on _our_ server
- analyze full process to reduce latency across the board
- research how to increase the speed of the openai voice produced, right now it talks very slowly
